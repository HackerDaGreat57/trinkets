# Trinkets

Handy little tools/scripts I use now and then to do tasks which would otherwise be very, **very** tedious. Mostly, they are downloaded, used, and deleted once, but some of them are designed to keep trudging along, doing what they do, forever.

You can go to the [trinkets/](./trinkets/ "Click here to go to this directory.") directory and browse the branch list to explore.
