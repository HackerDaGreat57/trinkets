# Trinkets

Handy little Shell scripts I use now and then to do tasks which would otherwise be very, **very** tedious.

## buildgcc

Does what it says. This is a user-friendly shell script which lets you choose how your custom build of [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org "Click here to go to GCC's official website") will behave, among many other options. I created this script because I attempted building GCC from source manually many moons ago and thought I'd contribute a lot to humanity by providing means of building GCC that don't involve brain and eye torture.

Basically, I do the dirty work, look through GCC manuals for several dozen eyestraining hours, and create the script. You execute the script, do what it says, and enjoy your GCC build. A huge improvement to quality of life.
