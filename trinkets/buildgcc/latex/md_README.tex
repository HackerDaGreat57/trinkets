Does what it says. This is a user-\/friendly program which lets you choose how your custom build of \href{https://gcc.gnu.org}{\texttt{ GCC}} will behave, among many other options. I created this program because I attempted building GCC from source manually many moons ago and thought I\textquotesingle{}d contribute a lot to humanity by providing means of building GCC that don\textquotesingle{}t involve brain and eye torture.

Basically, I do the dirty work, look through GCC manuals for several dozen eyestraining hours, and create the program. You execute it, do what it says, and enjoy your GCC build. A huge improvement to quality of life.

It is written in ANSI C, has only one external dependency ({\ttfamily ncurses}) and should work on any modern Linux distribution; with some modification, perhaps it can also run on Windows and mac\+OS. The only officially supported architectures for Linux are x86-\/64 and arm64. ncurses source code is included in an archive and it will automatically be built if necessary by the buildgcc build script (usually this only happens the first time you run it).

{\bfseries{Before you use this program}} you need to have some version (preferably 11) of GCC already installed. How will you build it without a compiler? ;)\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{How to use buildgcc}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repository
\item Go to the buildgcc root. You might already be here or it might be in {\ttfamily trinkets/buildgcc} depending on where you cloned it from.
\item Run {\ttfamily build.\+linux.\{arch\}}, where {\ttfamily \{arch\}} is the architecture of your computer (run the build-\/n-\/run variant of the script if you would like to execute the binary it as soon as it\textquotesingle{}s done building)
\item The binary will be placed in {\ttfamily bin/\{arch\}/}
\item Follow the instructions in the program, and enjoy your GCC build. Report bugs at the \href{https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/trinkets}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub repository}}.

I use \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/}{\texttt{ Doxygen}} to generate documentation from code. Doxygen greatly reduces the amount of work I have to do to maintain documentation, and the work you have to do to discern comments from code.
