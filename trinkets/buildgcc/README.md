# buildgcc

Does what it says. This is a user-friendly program which lets you choose how your custom build of [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org "Click here to go to GCC's official website") will behave, among many other options. I created this program because I attempted building GCC from source manually many moons ago and thought I'd contribute a lot to humanity by providing means of building GCC that don't involve brain and eye torture.

Basically, I do the dirty work, look through GCC manuals for several dozen eyestraining hours, and create the program. You execute it, do what it says, and enjoy your GCC build. A huge improvement to quality of life.

It is written in ANSI C, has only one external dependency (`ncurses`) and should work on any modern Linux distribution; with some modification, perhaps it can also run on Windows and macOS. The only officially supported architectures for Linux are x86-64 and arm64. ncurses source code is included in an archive and it will automatically be built if necessary by the buildgcc build script (usually this only happens the first time you run it).

**Before you use this program** you need to have some version (preferably 11) of GCC already installed. How will you build it without a compiler? ;)

## How to use buildgcc

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the buildgcc root. You might already be here or it might be in `trinkets/buildgcc` depending on where you cloned it from.
3. Run `build.linux.{arch}`, where `{arch}` is the architecture of your computer (run the build-n-run variant of the script if you would like to execute the binary it as soon as it's done building)
4. The binary will be placed in `bin/{arch}/`
5. Follow the instructions in the program, and enjoy your GCC build. Report bugs at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/trinkets "Click here to go to the repository.").

The first 10 arguments passed to the build-n-run scripts will also be passed to the program.
